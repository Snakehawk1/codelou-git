    <h1>Soul Narrative</h1>
      <h3>In a noisy world 'expert' voices are not always reliable</h3>
    <h3>But there are informed individuals with heart who apply knowledge wisely and share it.</h3>
    <h3> In this spirit we gain a footing on matters that have an impact on our lives and open up the discourse.</h3>
      <h4> The aim of this site is to soulfully interact, speak the truth, and exchange information regarding world developments, 
        in a dynamic present-tense-past-tense context.  Topics of interest may include topics like
        immunizations, NATO, Julian Assange, the military industrial complex, Russiagate, etc.</h4>
    <p>Forms of information and exchange may range from articles and interviews, short and long, podcasts and videos, 
      to quick takes and clickable charts to make complicated subjects fun and easier to learn.</p>
    <p>Hope you'll stop in and give a click, a read and maybe even a comment</p>
    <p>Thanks, the very best to you, William Spencer</p>
