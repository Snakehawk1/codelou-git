    <h1>Soul Narrative</h1>
      <h3>In a noisy world 'expert' voices are not always reliable</h3>
    <h3>But there are people with an intelligent heart who apply knowledge wisely and share it.</h3>
    <h3> In this spirit we probe to learn and get a footing on matters that have an impact on our lives.</h3>
      <h4> The aim of this site is to soulfully interact, speak the truth, and exchange information regarding world developments,
        in a dynamic present/past/future tense context.  Topics of interest may include
        immunizations, NATO, Julian Assange, the military industrial complex, Russiagate, etc.</h4>
    <p>Forms of information and exchange may range from articles and interviews, podcasts and videos,
      quick takes and clickable charts to somehow simplify subjects make them fun, and generate clarity.</p>
    <p>I Hope you'll stop in and give a click, a read and maybe even a comment</p>
    <p>Thanks, the very best to you, William Spencer</p>
