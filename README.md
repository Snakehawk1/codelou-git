# codelou-git
Greetings, and thanks for checking out William Spencer's
codelou-git project.  Out of interest in world events I 
thought it would be fun and engaging to create a site for 
political analysis and discussion.  

You will find featured in this project, use of jQuery, flexbox, 
and bootstrap in items like the sticky page title, the vertical
nav bar and in the modal (popup).  Note that jQuery and bootstrap
links are sourced within the coding.  

In addition I played with color placement and use of svg and jpg
images. The modal is intended to be a weekly analysis box providing brief
explanation and links for summarizations of whatever event or topic
gets chosen.  If I decide to post this as a working page, I may add a link
on the page to open archived modal analysis summaries done on the site. 

The design of this page allows for further creative innovation, such as 
adding new links, new departments, one of which I would like to add to
be podcast discussions and interviews.  

Thanks again for visiting.  ---- William Spencer, March, 16, 2019
